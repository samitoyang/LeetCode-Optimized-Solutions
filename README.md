# LeetCode-Optimized-Solutions

## Introduction

This collection presents some of my C++ solutions for LeetCode problems, optimized for minimal lines of code and enhanced flexibility to adapt to more generalized problems, all while adhering to the highest standards for Time/Space complexity. These solutions are likely the shortest and most elegant C++ coding ever published on LeetCode. For each solution, more detailed information is available on the following solution links on LeetCode.
